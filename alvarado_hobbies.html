        <p class="image_1">Kelly has enjoyed playing golf most of her life and was able to share some time on the links with her daughter on Mothers Day one year.<br>
        The weather was not perfect but they both had an amazing time.  Kelly cherishes these times she gets to spend with her children making memories and sharing hobbies.</p>

        <p class="image_2">The weather gets pretty hot here in Nebraska over the Summer so Kelly gets to the pool anytime she can.<br>
        The kids are both water babies, although, Isabel was particularly tired today so she fell asleep while floating around on the water.</p>

        <p class="image_3">During a golf outing, Kelly won a raffle prize that provided a trip to Estes Park, Colorado.  Kelly and Tim took advantage of this time away and took the trip<br>
        in February of 2020.  There was hiking, brewery visits, and a trip to the Stanley Hotel for a haunted tour and whiskey tasting.</p>
