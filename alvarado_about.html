    <div id="about-info">
       <p>Kelly is a 38-year-old mother of 2, Isabel (6 years old) and Killian (3 years old).  She has been married to her husband, Tim, for 7 years.  They met playing soccer 10 years ago.  She lives in Bellevue Nebraska with her family. <br>
        She grew up in in Omaha Nebraska and is the youngest of 3, she has an older sister and brother.  Kelly grew up going to catholic school and stayed in that system through high school.  <br>
        She attended Hasting college where she played soccer and achieved all American honors as a forward.</p>

        <p>After college Kelly worked in a graphic design position with a company called FastSigns in the Omaha area.<br>  
        She made a transition to a more corporate role in 2016 at ConAgra and has been with a few different companies since then and currently works for Scoular<br>
        where she manages accounts with brokers who deal internationally with commodities.  Kelly dreams of one day owning her own business and being her own boss.</p>

        <p>Kelly enjoys traveling, snowboarding, playing soccer and working on arts and crafts projects.  She has become quite the gardener over the last two years and is awaiting the ripening of her first watermelon!<br>
        She has many favorite sports teams, some even contradicting each other, that include the Denver Broncos, Kansas City Chiefs, Manchester United, and USMNT/USWNT soccer.<br>
        Kelly draws inspiration from former president and first lady Barrack and Michelle Obama as well as a longtime friend from her childhood, Rachel.</p>  
        
        <p>Kelly enjoys a very eclectic variety of music that ranges from R&B to alternative rock but has a very deep dislike of heavy rock/screaming music.<br>
        She likes watching documentaries and psychological thrillers.</p>  

        <p>Her travels have taken her to places in the US such as Seattle Washington, California, and various Midwest states.  She has traveled to Ireland in college and would love to go back.<br>
        One of her favorite places to be is in the mountains of Colorado, where she snowboards and hikes through places like Rocky Mountain National Park and Steamboat Springs.</p>

        <p>Kelly cannot pick one color as her favorite but instead loves the rainbow because it encompasses many emotions as well as how each color supports one another.<br>
        Thanksgiving is her favorite holiday because of the food but also because it brings families together without the expectations of gifts.</p>

        <p>Kelly would love to have a sit-down conversation with the Obama's and discuss how to play her part in the improvement of communities.</p>

        <p>There are so many memories that she has built throughout her life but one that really resonates with her is the birth of her son, Killian, and bringing him home in the extreme cold of January.</p>
